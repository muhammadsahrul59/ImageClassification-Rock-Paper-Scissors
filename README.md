# ImageClassification-Rock-Paper-Scissors

- Implemented image augmentation techniques for enhanced model generalization. Utilized ImageDataGenarator for
efficient image processing.
- Divided the dataset into training and validation sets with a 40% validation set size.
- Completed model training within a time frame of 30 minutes. Achieved a model accuracy exceeding 99%
- Implemented four advanced techniques: Callback, Checkpoint, Early Stopping, and Dropout
